These are the assignments I worked on for AMATH482: Computational Methods in Data Analysis, at University of Washington during winter quarter of 2019. Each folder contains the <b>.m</b> file , raw data files (these are somewhat spotty– some are not included due to large file size) and the <b>.pdf</b> file of written reports, which are password protected. Please email me at the address in my profile if you would like to get access to these (Please note that if you are a current student at the UW, I will not be able to grant access to the reports-- if you are planning to take this course though, the experience will definitely be an enjoyable one! 😊)
