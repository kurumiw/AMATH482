What I did:
Test case 1:
    - Created a filter around the paint can (width ~60 pixels, works well if little horizontal mvmt)
        - This filter multiplies everything outside of that rectangular window by 0
    - Converted the frames to grayscale in loop, applied the filter
    - Finding the pixels in which the intensity of white is at max (255)
        - picked the min index of y (the top-most because even with the horizontal filtering the whites were not
          sufficiently localized to the flashlight)
    - Threw out one frame that had intensity value less than 255 at the location of flashlight
